# Phishing Message and Email Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify messages and emails as phishing or legitimate. The model is trained using a dataset from Hugging Face containing various messages and emails labeled as either phishing or non-phishing. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate classifier to enhance cybersecurity measures by detecting potentially harmful communications.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes a dataset from Hugging Face containing messages and emails with their corresponding labels.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the data to prepare it for model training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from the messages and emails for better classification.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model to classify messages and emails as phishing or non-phishing.
